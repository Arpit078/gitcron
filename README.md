# gitcron
a nodeJS based script to perform git pulls and pushes while manipulating the repository with custom functions.
## purpose 
So I recently updated my personal website(sometime in march 2023) and it's always been a hassle to put in the time to list your projects or recent happenings on a hardcoded website, hosting an api on a free tier shared server looks stupid for they consistently put the servers on sleep if no request comes there way.
Since I do not own my personal server Hardcoding is the best option for a website whose content does not vary a lot for a while,  

## flow
This program looks into my shared notion database, google sheets and scrapes a webpage to update certain repositories to be precise updates db for my portfolio website, tweets on x and updates stories on https://premchandstories.vercel.app/ everytime I boot up my laptop without a single click! isn't it cool✌️
