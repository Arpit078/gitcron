# gitcron
a nodeJS based script to perform git pulls and pushes while manipulating the repository with custom functions.
## purpose 
So I recently updated my personal website and it's always a hassle to put in the time to list your projects or recent happenings on a hardcoded website.
Since I do not own my personal server, hosting a api on a shared server looks stupid for it's super fast response time right? 

## flow
This program looks into a google sheet which I can update using any device, everynight 12am it compares the projects and commits to main repository of
my portfolio website.
